                    Development</h2>
                <h3 class="text-xl text-[#A3D3FE] font-semibold mb-4">Frameworks Considered</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This week, I explored a few different web frameworks to figure out what would make the most
                    sense for our website.
                </p>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-lg text-[#DCA2DC] font-semibold mb-1">React + Next.js</h4>
                    <p>
                        This was one of the more full-featured options. Next.js comes with built-in routing,
                        server-side rendering, static site generation, and even simple API routes. The
                        file-based routing system is a big win—it automatically maps files in the app or pages
                        directory to routes, which makes things super easy to manage and keeps everything really
                        organized.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-lg text-[#DCA2DC] font-semibold mb-1">React + react-router-dom</h4>
                    <p>
                        This combo gives you more flexibility and control, but also requires more setup and
                        configuration. It's a solid option for single-page apps that don't need server-side
                        rendering. I appreciated the simplicity, but there's a bit more boilerplate involved
                        compared to something like Next.js. Also, things like code-splitting, metadata handling,
                        and SEO need to be wired up manually. But if you're looking for a lightweight solution
                        and don't need all the bells and whistles, this is a good choice.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h4 class="text-lg text-[#DCA2DC] font-semibold mb-1">Astro</h4>
                    <p>
                        Astro was really interesting—it's heavily optimized for performance and ships very
                        little JavaScript to the client. Perfect for mostly-static, content-driven sites. One of
                        the standout features is the ability to use components from multiple frameworks (React,
                        Vue, Svelte, etc.) in the same project.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-lg text-[#DCA2DC] font-semibold mb-1">React with Vite</h4>
                    <p>
                        Instead of using Create React App, I decided to try Vite. It's a build tool that's super
                        fast and has a great dev server. Vite is designed for modern web development and focuses
                        on speed and performance. It uses native ES modules in the browser, which means you get
                        instant hot module replacement (HMR) and really fast builds.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="italic text-gray-400 my-6">
                    <p>
                        Ironically, the hardest part of this entire process wasn't building the website—it was
                        choosing the tech stack to build it with. There are so many options, each with their own
                        trade-offs, and it's easy to fall into a rabbit hole trying to pick the "perfect" one.
                        It honestly feels like half the challenge these days is just decision fatigue.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-2">
                        It would be amazing to have one tool that handles everything cleanly—simple setup,
                        reusable components, good SEO, easy routing, and low-maintenance development—without
                        needing to piece together a bunch of tools and libraries.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    After weighing everything, sticking with React (in some form) just makes sense for now.

                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <p>
                        For the initial structure of the website, I used Claude Desktop to speed things up. The
                        current workflow is pretty straightforward: I take a screenshot of the Figma design, drop it
                        into Claude Desktop, and ask it to generate the code using Model Context Protocol (MCP). I
                        know there are MCPs for Figma, but I haven't had a chance to try them out yet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Claude is surprisingly good at capturing the overall layout and component structure.
                        It's not the best with styling things yet, but it gives me a solid starting point. Once
                        the initial code is generated, I go in and manually refine the styling to match the
                        original design more closely.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This setup has been really helpful for cutting down on boilerplate and letting me focus
                        more on fine-tuning the UI and integrating functionality.

                    with Roo Code</h2>
                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <p>
                        As part of our push to make AI more integrated in our day-to-day coding workflow, I spent
                        time this week experimenting with Roo Code while building some functionalities in the REPL.
                        The goal is to figure out how to make the AI more useful and less of a distraction. I wanted
                        to see how Roo could help with that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since this was a week focused on UX, a big part of the experimentation was seeing how
                        Roo could help improve not just the code itself, but the overall developer experience. I
                        played with different interaction patterns and workflows to see what worked best.

                    <h3 class="text-xl text-[#A3D3FE] font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Practical AI Advice Learned</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most helpful insights was realizing how important small, frequent
                        interactions are. Here are some guidelines I found useful and will likely turn into
                        working habits:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc pl-5">
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-[#F6C177] font-semibold">Review constantly:</span> Don't wait until a
                            large chunk is written—review AI suggestions as you go, it gets messy quickly, and there is
                            a lot of noise in the suggestions. This helps keep the changes manageable and makes it
                            easier to spot duplicate or irrelevant code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-[#F6C177] font-semibold">Commit or stage changes</span> as soon as you're
                            happy with them. This keeps the working state clean and reduces the mental overhead of
                            tracking everything at once. Also makes it easier to roll back if needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Roo seems to reference open tabs, so <span class="text-[#F6C177] font-semibold">keeping only
                                the relevant files open</span> helps reduce noise in the context window.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the context window starts getting full, <span
                                class="text-[#F6C177] font-semibold">asking Roo to summarize the current session</span>
                            and then starting a new one makes the experience a lot smoother and keeps the model focused.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl text-[#A3D3FE] font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Rules and Expectations for Roo</h3>
                    <p>
                        To make the AI feel more predictable and aligned with how we work, I started drafting a
                        few rules and expectations—things I'd like Roo to always follow when contributing code:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc pl-5">
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-[#F6C177] font-semibold">Avoid code duplication.</span> Prefer using
                            existing utilities/components/functions before reaching for something new. Reuse over
                            reinvention.
                        </li>
